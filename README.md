About: Bridging Borders was created to help unearth the beauty of the world we live in.        
        Though our ability to travel may have been put on pause, we are still ready to play. 
        Immerse yourself in different cultures and expand your world from the comfort of your own home.
        We hope that learning about other parts of the world will bring us all closer together.
