            <p>The Tengwang Pavilion (Pavilion of Prince Teng) is one of the Four Great Towers of southern China and has been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. 
                First constructed in 653 AD, it is the only existing royal architecture in all of southern China. 
                Now it sits atop a 39 foot tall concrete platform, which represents the destroyed ancient city wall. 
                The pavilion is undoubtedly the focal point of Nanchang’s tourist attraction due to its art and history; even the streets around have been designed to match its style.

            <p>Every evening, there is a lightshow that plays on the sides of bulidings by the waterfront, in sync with the fountain. 
                Visible from either side of the Gan River, the skyscrapers display colorful animations and shapes along with a variety of music. 
                Quishui Square, the best place to watch the show from, is already central to many shops and restaurants; the show is an absolute cannot-miss!

            <p>Wanda’s Nanchang Theme Park opened in 2016, and it was inspired by aspects of the landscape, such as lagoons, terraced walkways, and hills. 
                The designers wanted the park to reflect local stories and culture, and since communities have been doing pottery for centuries, 
                they decided on the Pottery Village which showcases their craft. A highlight is a roller coaster that goes through a simulated pottery kiln. 
                Every detail of the park is well thought out and meaningful, down to even the entrance.
