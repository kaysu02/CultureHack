         <p>If you’re looking to immerse in a cozy, indoor environment- Seattle, Washington is the place for you. 
             Because of its often rainy and overcast weather, the city has developed a unique culture built on snug coffee shops, 
             eclectic art museums, and a local grunge music scene.

            <p>Most prominently known as the home of coffee giant, Starbucks, Seattle is no stranger to the world of coffee. 
                However, the city’s love for coffee began much earlier. In the 1970s, independent coffee shops began popping up all around the city. 
                These cafes created a safe haven from the weather outside, and a quaint meeting place for locals. Today, you can find a wide array of coffee shops 
                from corporation chains to mom-and-pop single locations, which thrive and coexist with Seattlelites' constant need for caffeine.

            <p>The Pacific Northwest grunge music scene began and skyrocketed throughout the 1980s, with its epicenter in Seattle. 
                The combination of influences from the rock era of music in the 1960s and Seattle’s anti-conformist culture after the Vietnam War led to the emergence of the grunge genre. 
                Bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana started out in Seattle and quickly made huge impacts on the music industry as a whole. Today, remnants of the glory days still remain in the city. 
                Seattle is still a hub for indie and alternative artists and home to many small local venues, perfect for music discovery.
